A Python command line utility I put together so I can use a master
password and have it generate a site specific password for each site
that needs a password.

The passwords generated are carefully massaged to try to fit just
about every site's password requirements and keep at least 60 bits of
entropy in every password.

It uses the PKCS#5 v2.0 PBKDF2 with a large (but configurable) number
of iterations to make sure that even if an attacker manages to get the
plaintext password for a given site, it will be practically impossible
for them to reverse the hash and figure out the master password.
